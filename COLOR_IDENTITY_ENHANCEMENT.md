# Color Identity Enhancement for Singleton Formats

## Summary
Enhanced the AI recommendation system to properly weight color identity for singleton formats like Commander, EDH, Brawl, and Oathbreaker where color identity is a hard constraint rather than just a deckbuilding guideline.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Color Synergy Calculation
- **Format Detection**: System now detects singleton formats (`commander`, `edh`, `brawl`, `oathbreaker`)
- **Differential Scoring**: Color identity matches receive much higher scores in singleton formats
- **Violation Penalties**: Cards outside color identity receive severe penalties (0.05 vs 0.15 in constructed)

### 2. Color Identity Weighting by Format
#### Singleton Formats (Commander/EDH/Brawl):
- **Perfect Match**: 0.78-0.99 (depending on commander colors)
- **Color Violations**: 0.02-0.05 (nearly unplayable)
- **Colorless Cards**: 0.75 (slight bonus)

#### Constructed Formats (Standard/Modern/etc):
- **Perfect Match**: 0.55-0.85
- **Partial Match**: 0.30-0.55
- **No Overlap**: 0.15

### 3. Enhanced Color Compatibility Checking
- **Singleton Formats**: Checks `color_identity` field from Scryfall (includes mana symbols in rules text)
- **Constructed Formats**: Checks only mana cost colors
- **Stricter Validation**: Cards with any colors outside commander identity are flagged as incompatible

### 4. Adjusted Deck Fit Scoring
- **Color Weight**: Increased from 25% to 40% for singleton formats
- **Other Weights**: Reduced curve (15%) and archetype (25%) to compensate
- **Format-Aware**: Scoring adapts automatically based on format parameter

### 5. Enhanced Recommendation Reasons
- **Format-Specific Messages**: 
  - "✓ Legal in color identity (W/U)" for singleton formats
  - "⚠ Color identity violation (R/G not allowed)" for illegal cards
  - "Excellent Commander staple" for high-scoring cards
- **Violation Warnings**: Clear indicators when cards can't be played

## Test Results

```
Card Name            Colors   Standard   Commander  Difference
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Dovin's Veto         W/U      0.810      0.940      +0.130
Path to Exile        W        0.730      0.880      +0.150
Brainstorm           U        0.730      0.880      +0.150
Sol Ring             C        0.700      0.750      +0.050
Lightning Bolt       R        0.150      0.050      -0.100
Llanowar Elves       G        0.150      0.050      -0.100
Abzan Charm          W/B/G    0.383      0.050      -0.333
```

## Impact
- **Commander Recommendations** now properly prioritize legal cards
- **Color Violations** are effectively filtered out by low confidence scores
- **Format Flexibility** maintained for constructed formats while respecting singleton constraints
- **User Experience** improved with clear explanations of color identity compliance

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/enhanced_recommendations_sync.py`
  - Enhanced `_calculate_color_synergy()` with format-specific logic
  - Updated `_calculate_deck_fit_score()` with dynamic weighting
  - Improved `_is_color_compatible_scryfall_card()` with color identity checking
  - Enhanced `_generate_synergy_reasons()` with format-aware messages

## Usage
The system automatically detects format from the `format_name` parameter:
- `"commander"`, `"edh"`, `"brawl"` → Singleton format rules
- `"standard"`, `"modern"`, `"pioneer"` → Constructed format rules

No API changes required - existing code will automatically benefit from enhanced color identity awareness.
